	<h3>WELCOME BACK TO MY BLOG!</h3> 
	 <p>I know it's been a while I post but I'm back now and I will be commiting a big crime if i refuse to share 
	my experience to <b> kwatin Island </b> with y'all. The first thing you should know is that any gist you hear about kwatin 
	is an understatement , I'm so exicted just typing this and having a flash back at the entiretrip, I will really love to
	 go there with few of you guys next year April during Easter break so let's go carry our <i>piggy bank </i>cause it's saving O'clock again.</P>
